# ChatRoom
## C++ Chat Room
This is a chatroom project developed in C++ using the ncurses library, sockets, and multithreading, primarily on a Linux/Ubuntu system. The project implements a client/server (C/S) architecture.

Server: Manages multiple client connections and handles message forwarding to ensure real-time communication between clients.
Client: Provides a user interface with a chat message window and an input window. The ncurses library is used to create a graphical interface in the terminal, allowing users to view all chat messages in the message window and enter new messages in the input window.
This project serves as a practical example of network programming and terminal interface development in C++.
